A discord bot that I programmed 2019-2023 with functions such as music-playing, economy, statistics and quotes/photos of the day. I no longer regularly maintain this bot, therefore I have published it here as a template tool.


## Prerequisites

* Node.js v18+ `to run the bot process` from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* Mongo Database URL `to run the economy commands` from [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
* Discord Client ID `to refresh (/) commands with REST API` from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* Discord Bot Token `to log in to bot` from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* Process Manager 2 `to keep the bot online` from [Keymetrics](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)

## Installation

### Installing via NPM
Clone the mint-bot repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/talsel/mint-bot.git
```
Change directory to /mint-bot and add required tokens in `.env` file from pre-requisites then run:
```
npm install
```
Afterwards, you can start the bot by running:
```
node src/bot.js
```
If you would like to keep the bot online 24/7, you can run:
```
pm2 start src/bot.js
```

## Issues
